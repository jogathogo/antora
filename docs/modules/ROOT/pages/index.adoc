== Overview

Fineract is a headless core banking platform meaning it does not have a UI. It is fully API driven whereby all operations are carried out by making API calls and getting a response.

the Mifos UI generally works with Fineract but may not fully support all apache fineract features.

The platform supports most of the standard banking operations: client management, account management, loans, accounting, short/long term deposits and reporting.

A number of configurative and administrative features are available out of the box, these include: roles and permissions, product definition, user management, maker/checker, two factor authentication and many more.

As an open-source project, Fineract is constantly being updated with new features and improvements.
